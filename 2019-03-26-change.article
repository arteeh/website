When you are the least happy, that is when you can bring about the most change
March 16, 2019
When you remove short-term mood enhancers (video games, TV), you will see clearly all the things wrong in your life.
Media will hide our problems today but waste the limited time we have to make our lives fulfilling.
Pain is intrinsic to our species.
Systematic prevention of pain will lead to unfulfilling lives and an underachieving society.
Conclusion: I dearly hope that you, the reader, will take something away from this text. Every second from now until you're gone, there is a chance that you will die. Take a good look at your life and list all the things you want to achieve before you die, and start working on them. Spend a month or even a week without video games, television, books and most importantly the internet, and see if you're a happy person without all these sedaters. If you are, you're doing great, keep going. If you're not, you have work to do.
