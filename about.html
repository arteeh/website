<p>I'm arteeh, and you are looking at my website. Currently I'm a computer science student and i spend most of my time on that. My favourite games are Skyrim, Mass Effect, Destiny and Minecraft. I also like to read. I am mostly still figuring out what I'm gonna do with my life. I hope to document this journey on the homepage, which I am pretty excited for. I've always wanted to write.</p>

<p>If you want to get in touch, you can DM me on my twitter which you can find on the bottom of this page.</p>
