		I'm Maarten de Jong (but online I'm arteeh), and you are looking at my website. Currently I'm a computer science student at Hogeschool Windesheim in Zwolle and i spend most of my time on that. Besides school, i like to play video games like Skyrim, Mass Effect and Destiny (1, but that doesn't need to be said). I also like to program and read books. I am mostly still figuring out what I'm gonna do with my life, but i think i'm getting close. I hope to document this journey on my blog on the homepage, which i'm pretty excited for. I've always wanted to write.
