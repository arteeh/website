<p>Lately I’ve been thinking about writing. I imagined myself to be a full-time writer instead of a programmer or engineer, and the former excited me more. In fact, many creative media interest me right now (music, art). Maybe it’s the dullness and stress of my current school assignments. Maybe it’s because i’ve been spending more time on /lit/ in order to avoid the more vulgar boards. I have this itch nonetheless so here I am.</p>

<p>The last six months have been very intense for me. It started when my girlfriend broke up with me and i lost all sense of security in my future. She was my safety net. Losing it  had a big impact on my self-confidence and mental health. However, the problems I’ve been facing since about February are not about the breakup anymore. It’s a new kind of instability that I myself have to take responsibility for. It’s a very interesting kind of instability. I think i wouldn’t like myself as much if i never had it. It makes me a more interesting person. It made me start writing this.</p>

<p>The instability is divided into small phases. These phases come, go, come back, and go away again. One phase i am happy. I’m content with the way things are going and i wouldn’t change anything. The problem is that i wouldn’t change anything. I leave this phase when i realise this problem. I feel like i’ve been wasting my time and i need to fix myself. But before that, self loathing and depression ensues.</p>

<p>Another phase i am crazy. That’s the best way i can describe it without this text sounding crazy. I see joy in the most joyless things and i get sad over insignificant events. The joy part is where I am the happiest. These short moments have been the most beautiful parts of this year. They are usually accompanied by a really good song and a lack of care for the people around me. I truly feel like i am the happiest when i am alone. But i am also the saddest. In social settings, i’m in between the two and it’s revolting.</p>

<p>I don’t know where i am going from here. Ever since i lost motivation in a future in tech i haven’t known what i want to be. I have a general idea - a vision - of the type of person i’m working towards becoming, but i don’t know how i’ll get there, and through which career path. This is also kind of liberating. The idea that i could drop out of university right now and i wouldn’t even care, as my loved ones are concerned, is interesting to me. Secretly, i hope that something like that will happen. I would set myself on a path that i can’t go back from. It’s a path off the highway and i’m terrified of the highway i’m on right now. I’m studying computer science, and i like most of it, but god forbid i become a computer scientist. I’m better than that.</p>

<p>I feel like i am going to become something greater than that. It’s an instinct i hope other great people have as well. I hear stories from great people about this feeling and it inspires me. It reminds me that i’m not deluded and that things are going to be okay. This feeling is irrational however. There is no logic in it. All my friends and family will tell me this but i shouldn’t listen to it. The great people didn’t either and now they’re successful.</p>

<p>I am 19 years old. I work out every monday, wednesday and friday. I run to the first windmill and back, which is about 5 kilometers. Yesterday i managed to reach the windmill without walking. I should be proud of this but it was too easy. I don’t know why i couldn’t do it earlier. I guess it was the album i was listening to (A Moon Shaped Pool by Radiohead).</p>

<p>I don’t have a girlfriend. I think about it alot but in the back of my mind i know i don’t need one. Girls are too complicated to deal with and they won’t make me happy. Girls don’t seem to like me either. I disabled the mirrored mode on my phone and looked at myself and it ruined my day. In my head i seem like a good looking guy. I need to keep telling myself that i wasn’t much happier back when i did have a girlfriend, just more stable. I know exactly what the girl of my dreams is like but i’ll spare this piece of paper (and my brain) the details. It’s funny how we have these very specific feelings. The thought of my ideal soulmate is one of them. I could give it a color, or a sound, but not words. If i make words out of it i’ll ruin the feeling. It’ll be real and the magic will be gone. It’s like a mysterious person, or a computer processor. When you see them as they are they are the most interesting things. But when you know everything about them, they’re just like every other set of particles in the universe. Just more closely condensed.</p>

<p>Right now i’m thinking about whether i should keep this as a personal journal or put it on my website. I built the website for this kind of journaling, but now that i look at the actual text, it seems too sacred to use for anything. I know i want to put it on my website in order to impress my friends. I want to show them that i have these thoughts, that i am interesting. I want to put it on my website to brag about my brain. I realise how stupid this is now that i’ve articulated it. I’m gonna keep this personal for now. Maybe i’ll send snaps of parts of it to fuel that other part of me, even though it’s wrong. But i know i’ll do it so i might as well face this flaw rather than pretend it’s not there.</p>

<p>Maybe i should get back into Buddhism. I crave money and attention and it’s making me unhappy.</p>

<p>I want to rip my heart out</p>
<p>and show it to the world.</p>
<p>I am so miserable</p>
<p>but I love the world too much.</p>
<br>
<p>I wonder what will happen</p>
<p>if I stop loving.</p>
<p>Will i pass silently?</p>
<p>Or will i finally find</p>
<p>the stable peace I want so badly?</p>
<br>
<p>Goodnight for now,</p>
<p>tomorrow I will be okay</p>
<p>The day after tomorrow I won't.</p>

<p id="time">18:23</p>

<p>I will put this on my website. I won’t tell anyone about it. I hope no one will read it. And if they do, I hope they won’t tell me about it. Most things beyond small talk are probably better off written but unspoken.</p>

<p>Once again I’m unhappy because I don’t have what I want. Still looking into fixing this.</p>
