When you are the least happy, that is when you can bring about the most change.

This is a test article.
</p>
<p>
When you remove short-term mood enhancers (video games, TV), you will see clearly all the things wrong in your life.
</p>
<p>
Media will hide our problems today but waste the limited time we have to make our lives fulfilling.
</p>
<h5>
Pain is intrinsic to our species.
</h5>
<p>
Systematic prevention of pain will lead to unfulfilling lives and an underachieving society.

<h4>
Conclusion
</h4>
<p>
I dearly hope that you, the reader, will take something away from this text. Every second from now until you're gone, there is a chance that you will die. Take a good look at your life and list all the things you want to achieve before you die, and start working on them. Spend a month or even a week without video games, television, books and most importantly the internet, and see if you're a happy person without all these sedaters. If you are, you're doing great, keep going. If you're not, you have work to do.
